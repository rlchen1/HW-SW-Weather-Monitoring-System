# HW-SW-Weather-Monitoring-System

Python project utilizing Raspberry Pi and sensors for artificial weather monitoring system. Python code and LCD API pull California CIMIS irrigation data from online server and display 
on LCD screens at predetermined intervals. DHT sensor and motion sensor record nearby temperature, humidity, and motion detection on LCD screen. LED light utilized to signal irrigation 
times under calculated circumstances. See report PDF for detailed breakdown and constructed circuitry.
